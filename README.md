# portfolio_website

My first Web-development project.
Built my Portfolio Using HTML and CSS at first, later included interactivity using Bootstrap for front-end and A little bit of JQuery at the end.
This is an ever-evolving project as it reflects my CS learning, progress and how my skills develop overtime.
